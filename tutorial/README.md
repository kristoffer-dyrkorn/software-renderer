# A fast and correct triangle rasterizer

Rasterization: Do draw a given triangle (decided by 3 points) on a pixel screen, using the specified color.

We will first build a simple version to get to know the concepts. Then we will gradually refine the code - and you will get to know more details and the reasoning behind the changes in each step.

1. An overview of the method
2. Some setup code to start with
3. The first, basic rasterizer
4. Moar triangles, moar problems
5. We've got to move it
6. Let's go continuous!
7. Let's fix this
8. Time to go incremental
9. Fixing a bug
10. Even more optimizations (?)
