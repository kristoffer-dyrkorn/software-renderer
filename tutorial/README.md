# A fast and correct triangle rasterizer

We will first build a simple version to get to know the concepts. Then we will gradually refine the code - and you will get to know more details and the reasoning behind the changes in each step.

The principles behind all of this - and some setup code

1. The first, basic rasterizer
2. Moar triangles, moar problems
3. Animation
   4a. Let's go continuous!
   4b. Let's fix this!
4. Time to go incremental
5. Fixing a bug
6. Even more optimizations (?)
